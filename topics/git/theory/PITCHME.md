## What is that?

+++

## Version control

@ul

- Specialized tool for code versioning
- Somewhat similar to save/load or undo/redo
- Simple to merge changes from several sources/authors
- **Much more powerful** capabilities
- Backup on the cloud and at other developers

### Similar but different

Need to change thinking -> have to think about checking code into the VCS

- Similarly to writing on a paper vs writing on a computer
- Simple files on a computer vs files in version control

## Why do you need it?

+++

### Why in general?

@ul

- Overview and control of development process
- Easier to collaborate on grou/project work
- **Industry standard**
- Backup of work (if you use cloud servcies like GitHub)
- Free hosted static page
- Portfolio
